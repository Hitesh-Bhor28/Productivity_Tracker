## 📌 **TASK DESCRIPTION**  

In today’s digital world, distractions are everywhere, making it difficult for users to stay productive. Social media, entertainment websites, and unnecessary browsing consume a significant portion of our time, reducing work efficiency.  

To solve this issue, I developed a **Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension** as part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS.  

This extension helps users:

- Storing user block websites locally  
- Syncing realtime website time across multiple tabs  
- Blocking and Unblocking feature
